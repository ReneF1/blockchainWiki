# Proof of Stake \(POS\)

Unlike [Proof of Work](proof-of-work.md), POS works with limited computing power involved. Instead of miners solving mathematical problems to create the next block, we have stakeholders voting for the next block by spending tokens on it. The correct block will be the one the majority of stakeholders vote for. stakeholders who vote on the correct Block will then be rewarded, while stakeholders who voted on the wrong one will loose their stake.
