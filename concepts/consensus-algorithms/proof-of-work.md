# Proof of Work \(POW\)

Proof of Work \(POW\) is a [Consensus Algorithm](./) that works by miners solving mathematical problems. The miner who first delivers a proof that he solved the problem, is allowed to write the next block on the chain. The correct chain is always the longest, so assuming at least 50% of miners are working on the longest chain, the blockchain will be secure.
